Before creating an SSH we need to understand what is SSH and what does it do.

##### What is Secure Shell Protocol(SSH)?
- SSH is a method for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network. The SSH uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices.
- SSH is secure because it incorporated encryption and authentication via process called public key cryptography. Public key cryptography is the way to encrypt the data, or sign data, with two different keys, one key is public, the other one is private kept by the owner.
- 
# What does SSH do? 
SSH can do remote encrypted connections  SSH sets up a connection between a users device and a faraway machine, often a server, It uses encryption to scramble the data that traverses the connection.
SSH also has abillty to tunnel, tunneling is a method for moving packets across a network using a protocol or path they would not ordinarily be able to use, Tunneling works by wrapping data packets with additional information called headers to change their destination.

##### When do we use SSH?
- SSH is often used for controlling servers remotely, for managing infrastructure, and for transferring files.
